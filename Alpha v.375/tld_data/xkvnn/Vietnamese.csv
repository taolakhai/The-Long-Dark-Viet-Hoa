You are about to play the Alpha version of The Long Dark, a post-disaster survival experience. We are constantly improving the game, which sometimes introduces bugs. We are constantly balancing the game, which means the experience can vary from update to update. This is part of the exploratory process of developing an Alpha with feedback from the community. We appreciate your patience as we continue to build the game, and we hope you can see the love we have put into it.

***

As the result of the geomagnetic disaster which serves as part of the fictional foundation of the game, we have taken liberties with the portrayal of wildlife behaviour. This geomagnetic disaster will be explained in the Story mode. We are not attempting to create ""realistic"" wildlife behaviour in the game. We know that Wolves do not typically attack people.

Hinterland Studio Inc. does not condone the wanton destruction of wildlife.

- Peter Heller, The Dog Stars",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteKing,"""No one can tell what goes on between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side."" 

- Stephen King, The Stand",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteMamet,"“You know, I once read an interesting book which said that, uh, most people lost in the wilds, they, they die of shame. Yeah, see, they die of shame. 'What did I do wrong? How could I have gotten myself into this?' And so they sit there and they... die. Because they didn't do the one thing that would save their lives. Thinking.”

- Seneca",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteThoreau,"""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.""

Arrived at the base of Timberwolf Mountain. Looks like there are some nice cracks, just like Clive said. Going to set up a top rope and do some bouldering until the others show up. Hopefully soon.

Sept 6th
Wondering if my friends got lost as they still haven't arrived. Woke up in the night to a deafening noise, and fire on the mountain. Went to check it out but the weather got nasty and I couldn't find my way.

Sept 7th
Clear day. I went out again. Found some metal cargo crates. They look like they might have come from a plane. There's still smoke coming from the summit. I'm heading out to see if I can make it to the peak and learn more about what's going on.",,
